# Finite-Volume-Discrete-Loss
 We propose a simulation-free PINNs training approach using a discrete numerical loss function instead of automatic differentiation, enabling efficient simulation of high Reynolds number flows. Our grid-based training strategy improves convergence, reduces computational cost, and outperforms traditional automatic differentiation.
